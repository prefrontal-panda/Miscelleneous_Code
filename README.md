# Miscelleneous_Code
This repository is to store code that is used by both the absence epilepsy and PTE experiments.

It contains two .Rmd files that were used to generate better and high-resolution figures for the purposes of thesis chapter and publications.
Also included are the steps that I used to run the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline ('_Instructions') and the script to run it ('_Script).
